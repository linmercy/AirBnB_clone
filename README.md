#AirBnB Clone Project

#Project Description

The project involves developing an AirBnB clone, starting with a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects. This includes implementing functionalities such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.

#Command Interpreter Description

The command interpreter provides a CLI for interacting with AirBnB objects. Users can perform various operations on objects, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them. The CLI also supports commands for displaying help information and quitting the interpreter.

#How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the console.py script.

$ ./console.py

#How to Use

Once the command interpreter is running, you can interact with it by typing commands. Use the help command to see the list of available commands and their usage.

(hbnb) help

#Examples

Here are some examples of commands you can use within the command interpreter:

(hbnb) create User
